<body class="Archaeology">
  <p>
    I’ve got bits I want to cut out. Bits that don’t work. They muddy up the picture or <a href="Invisibility.html" style="color: #ff4d4d;">say it wrong</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    But I don’t want to throw them away. <a href="Shapeshifter.html" style="color: #9999ff;">They were there</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Maybe I’ll have to apologize for them later; maybe I won’t.
  </p>

  <p>
    Either way, I think…I’d like to have them saved somewhere.
  </p>

  <p>
    Where they’re saved is for you to figure out, <a href="Source.html" style="color: white;">if you’re really that curious…</a>
