    <p>
      You may wonder at my motives.
    </p>

    <p>
      I will try to make everything clear, in time. I want you to feel stable footing while we are traveling together.
    </p>

    <p>
      But it must be remembered that clarity is a product of focal distance. That is to say…different things become clear through slight alterations to the lens or the looker. Some things go out of <a href="Focus.html" style="color: mediumvioletred;">focus</a> as others become sharp.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="Archaeology.html" style="color: #3366cc;">There is no absolute clarity</a>. There is only…mood. I think mood is the closest I can get.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is my sincere hope that, in time, we shall learn to navigate each other’s moods, so that our traveling together will ring out into the grander world with tones of harmony.
