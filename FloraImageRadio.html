<!--
The minimalist noun-collage style emerged from an initial desire to translate each poem into Mandarin Chinese using only the Chinese dictionary app Pleco. The idea was to create Chinese translations for each bit, then load those translations into Google Translate to see what it spit back, forming a final product that would exist in three columns: the original poem, my Chinese translation, the Google Translation of my Chinese. Included as comments below are the ones I did before giving up on that idea.

This series of poems was inspired by the 1987 album Flora by Hiroshi Yoshimura.
