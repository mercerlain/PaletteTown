    The point is not in situation…or characters…not in the drama of the actions and activities of the players. The point is simply that all of these scenes, from the most minute detail of the space (furniture and decor, the weather and time of day, the writing in the journal on the back shelf) to the interlocking features of nested contexts revealed by words and expression, all of these elements are a part of this world. This one world. There is no end to its depth, complexity, its ability to <a href="Shapeshifter.html" style="color: #9999ff;">shape shift</a> and offer up other modes. So this being the case, the question really is about input and output. What are your receptor sites looking for? What are you capable of processing? What are you asking of this world? Do you reach out a hand or don’t you?
