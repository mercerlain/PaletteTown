    <p>
      A gradient rainbow sky<br>
      Redline at the horizon and violet fading to blackdome starlit space at the zenith<br>
      Darkened by three screens of gray dusk<br>
      Horizon line contoured by blue-shade mountains and the silhouettes of tall evergreen trees<br>
      Moon and planet, lit bright, at a shallow diagonal with each other near the entrance to purple<br>
      Some clouds in nightshade against the gold and green and orange<br>
      Planes fly in low overhead, small stars of floating light fly away, deep<br>
      Several straw/peach lights in windows of boxy houses on the hill<br>
      Streetlamp connected to power line, daylight balanced<br>
      58 degrees Fahrenheit<br>
      Winds steady at 8mph from the east, gusts up to 15mph<br>
      Trees: pine, spruce, cedar, maple, several others I canâ€™t identify<br>
      We enter through <a href="ElectroLab.html" style="color: lightseagreen;">a sliding basement door</a>.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Update: the pine is not actually pine, but hemlock
