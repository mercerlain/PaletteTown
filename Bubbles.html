  Before experimentaions with Twine and hypertext as a medium for this sort of work began, I would occasionally create folders in my word processor app, Scrivener, that contained a linear collection of text pages, minimally styled with text color and such.
  This page was the first page in a Folder called "Growth." A few other pages in this piece come from that project.
