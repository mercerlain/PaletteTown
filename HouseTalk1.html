  Imagining houses is such an intimate activity to me. As a teenager, I remember roping several friends into conversations where we would trade off describing dream houses as a way of presenting intimate sentiments, like house-sonas. Like, do you live in a little cottage in the woods, or in a penthouse in a skyscraper? Does your house have tunnels running underneath? Trap doors? Secret passageways? An attic? Big windows? What can you see?

  I spent a lot of time playing The Sims as a kid.

      BUILDING HOUSES
    </p>

    <p>
      First off, where is this house?
    </p>

    <p>
      -Like an actual place?
    </p>

    <p>
      No not an actual place. That’s boring. We’re talking about dream structures here.
    </p>

    <p>
      I mostly mean, like, environment. Atmosphere. Like what biome, no, what ~zone~ is your house in? Like if someone were to be traveling to your place, what’s like the aesthetic feel of the surrounding environment? We gotta name your Zone! Like mine would be <a href="IKnowAWoman.html" style="color: Gainsboro;">Fern Forest Zone</a>. V Pacific Northwest. Rainy. Lots of gray-blue and teal-sage. Deep-greens against rust-red on the ground from fallen pine and spruce needles. Straw-gold tungsten lighting.
