  <body class="NoTaste">
    <p>
      Sounds of twigs and dry leaves underfoot<br>
      Letting the wind in, chilling the bones<br>
      Need a hot shower for hours<br>
      Settling into the nest for a season
    </p>

    <p>
      Smells of cinnamon and woodsmoke<br>
      In the blue city with someone in a cubicle after dark<br>
      Proximity of a million souls living without my witness<br>
      I buy a slice to feel warmer inside
    </p>

    <p>
      Feels like waking from a nap at the start of night<br>
      Would rather contemplate dream details than accept that no one else is here<br>
      Play by play commentary of a game that played out years ago<br>
      No one pays attention. <a href="SnoozeLore1.html" style="color: #00ebd6">Real life is elsewhere</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      This melancholy has no taste<br>
      Maybe newspaper or tap water? Something neutral and innocuous, commonplace<br>
      <a href="GreenImageRadio.html" style="color: teal;">These images are meaningless</a><br>
      Everything is the same
    </p>

    <p>
      It looks like today.<br>
      And yesterday.<br>
      It’s been around for a while.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      I think I am open to <a href="LoveAsSomeoneElse.html" style="color: red;">love...</a><br>
      I try to be open…<br>
    </p>
