<body class="HumanGravity">
  <p>
    Nose twitch.<br>
    *Sniff*<br>
    I know this feeling…<br>
    Gravity.<br>
    Human gravity, <a href="LoveAsSomeoneElse.html" style="color: red;">pulling me toward someone</a><br>
    I like it<br>
    I might really like it<br>
    But then it could scare me<br>
    Will…scare me
  </p>

  <p>
    No. No. Stop.<br>
    I don’t want to go there.<br>
    I remember supernovas, nerves seared and melted as we smashed each other to pieces<br>
    And the aftermath, thrown out of ourselves to become scattered clouds of space dust<br>
    The memories of being a star so close they still give off heat…<br>
    I put my hands to the thoughts,<br>
    but I know they will not be enough to keep me warm in the void…
  </p>

  <p>
    .<br>
    ..<br>
    …<br>
    ….<br>
    …..<br>
    ……<br>
    The Void.<br>
    I’ve been a particle alone in black ocean for so long…<br>
    I’ve forgotten.<br>
    I can see other bodies,<br>
    I try and try to send them signals,<br>
    But they’re all so far away,<br>
    My equipment is battered and malfunctioning. <br>
    I know I’ll die before I reach them<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    A spark!<br>
    I used to have gravity, I think…<br>
    I could play<br>
    Zip here and there, slingshot myself into new systems<br>
    I could <a href="Dance.html" style="color: #a3297a;">dance</a><br>
    Like Sirius, the double star<br>
    Our paths a helix spinning in space
  </p>

  <p>
    GATHER! <br>
    GATHER EVERYTHING!<br>
    Katamari Style<br>
    We’ve got to get bigger<br>
    Restore our gravity<br>
    <a href="DeepEnds.html" style="color: #6600ff;">Swim</a> harder! <br>
    We can reach them!<br>
  </p>
