<body class="VisitYourNeighbors">
  <p>
    I recommend visiting your neighbors at their houses. As many of them as you feel <a href="FloraImageRadio.html" style="color: #ff0c58;">comfortable</a> with. You may not like all of them, but itâ€™s good to get a feel for those around you. Makes the map less scary.
