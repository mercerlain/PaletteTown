<!--
  I like to call pages like this "Door Rooms" -
  Like: behind door number 1 is...
  Behind door number 2 is...

  They remind me of old internet pages where you could type /cgi-bin into the end of a URL and see the directory page
  Like rooting through a folder in console, but in the browser window
  Usually a plain white page with blue links in some sort of console/courier style font
  If you have any stories of hacking websites back in the day of web 1.0, please get at me!
  It was a big part of my early internet experience, and I'd love to share stories!

    <p>
      A room in a cave with many little <a href="DeepEnds.html" style="color: #6600ff;">pools</a> resting in cutoff stalactite formations on the cave floor. <a href="Bubbles.html" style="color: DodgerBlue;">Bubbling</a> <a href="ElectroLab.html" style="color: lightseagreen;">alchemical</a> soups. Each is different colored, some have patterns on the liquid surface. You can jump into them, like jumping into pictures in Mario 64. Take a long dive into some spaces:

      🌊 <a href="OpenDarkOcean.html" style="color: #4d4dff;">A dreamy pool with waves</a>

    <p>
      🍂 <a href="NoTaste.html" style="color: DarkSlateBlue;">A lonely pool that lets out a long, sad sigh</a>
