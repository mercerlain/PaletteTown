<!--
From an unreleased project called RAM
which sought to present multiple threads of thought and expression happening at the same time,
in a gradient of intimacy/privacy
like the outward expression of several in-person conversations on one layer (Audio Recording)
uploading thoughts to the internet on a hidden account for slightly more private or just unrelated thoughts (Online Feeds)
and a journal layer for deeply intimate/private or very unrelated/experimental thoughts (Scrivener)

This was one of the Scrivener pages
