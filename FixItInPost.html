<!--
  I'm kind of obsessed with the idea of leaving little notes in places for people to find. I feel a particular fondness for encouraging notes like this. There was a time in my life when I desperately needed to hear messages like this. A few times, upon spotting one out in the wild, I would feel like the universe was telling me to keep going. I might not have if not for those messages.

  So now I try to leave them lying around wherever I can.
