      Is the trapped feeling a power reversal? Bullying myself because I feel powerless to change my own situation? Or, rather, to live with my current situation? Stay in it until the next thing. Why am I so concerned with waiting out uncomfortable states? Thatâ€™s all I ever do is wait them out. <a href="ThisPlaceIsWishyWashy.html" style="color: navy;">Let the storm subside</a>. Bleh.

      WHY IS MY MAGIC NOT STRONG ENOUGH YET? <a href="WillIBeAbleToDealWithThis.html" style="color: olivedrab;">I THOUGHT I WOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE THESE THINGS BY NOW!!</a>
