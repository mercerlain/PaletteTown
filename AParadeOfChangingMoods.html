  <body class="AParadeOfChangingMoods">
    <p>
      I often daydream about a parade of changing moods. A shift from miraculous laserlight love to <a href="APhantomThatFollows.html" style="color: maroon;">bone-dread</a> in a shifting city-prison to prismatic orbital ratchet clicks of far out hands dirty discovery to a blanket-warm page turner <a href="NoTaste.html" style="color: DarkSlateBlue;">melancholy</a> with rain patter on a window. I feel them simultaneously, as I might upon reading the final page of an epic novel that included each in its due time. But I can’t bear the time. I can’t bear to compartmentalize these <a href="FeelsWithinFeels.html" style="color: Gold;">feelings</a> into time. They are all happening at once, and I don’t know how to cry out the sound of the buzzing, the harmonic and sometimes terrifying sound of so much in unison. I don’t even think I’m concerned with individual items. I am concerned with <a href="TheTableauOfDiligentRecordKeeping.html" style="color: lime;">colors conjured from overlay</a>. I am through with the essential, the simple. Give me a complexity that is so chaotic and sophisticated that it is unspeakable. Give me something that I must pass through that forces <a href="FloraImageRadio.html" style="color: #ff0c58;">the plants just beneath my skin</a> to sprout and grow wild. I wish to jettison these memories and imaginations that never get enough opportunities to <a href="Bubbles.html" style="color: DodgerBlue;">bubble</a> forth to the surface.
