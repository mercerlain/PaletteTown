  <body class="SnoozeLore1">
    <p>
      They livin’ good on Snooze Hill.<br>
      They read the sNews.<br>
      Their lives are the gentle white of clouds, the soft gold of <a href="VisitYourNeighbors.html" style="color: yellow;">a light in a window</a>.<br>
      A longing, nostalgic place but one that lies somewhere distantly in the future…<br>
      Like: One day we’ll get to Snooze.<br>
      We’ll be livin’ on Snooze. Reading the sNews. Catching some zZz’s.<br>
      Nice and easy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Snooze Hill is, from the porch, off to the right.<br>
      Like a mountain in the distance<br>
      But not quite so high as a mountain (it’s more of a hill)<br>
      And not so very far away (you could say it’s right there)<br>
      It looms close and low.<br>
      Easy. Eaaaaaasy. Relaaaaaaax.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the mode, or mood, of Snooze: Easy. Eaaaaaasy. <a href="FixItInPost.html" style="color: orangered;">Relaaaaaaax</a>.<br>
      Comfy as heck. All cloud pillows and chimney smoke.<br>
      Coffee in the morning with nothing to do all day.<br>
      No necessary work for months, at least.<br>
      Maybe years. Maybe never again.<br>
      Sunday-Stoned for days and days and days.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hit the Snooze button.
      <a href="AParadeOfChangingMoods.html" style="color: black;">Explore the daydream</a>, casually.
